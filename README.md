# Portfolio

Hosted by **Github Pages**, my portfolio site was created with **React**, generated from *create-react-app*. 
**Bootstrap and SASS** aided in the completion of my desired design.

My Recent Work displays my projects. 
Hovering over my projects will display a short description and links to both code on GitHub and a Live Demo (hosted on Netlify). 
Filter buttons are utilized to organize the massive amount of projects.

My contact information is displayed as a form for easier accessibility. 
Above the form there are links to my resume, phone number, and email(except on mobile).
On submit, the form redirects the user information to the email application connected to the userâ€™s device.
	 
 ***This site is mobile responsive***.
